Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and protecting REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS services or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make your APIs available to third-party application developers.
