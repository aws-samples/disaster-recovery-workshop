Failover routing allows you to route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy or to a different resource when the first resource is unhealthy. Primary and secondary records can route traffic to any point from an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a site to a complex log tree. For more information, see [Active/Passive Failover](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-types.html#dns-failover-types-active-passive).
