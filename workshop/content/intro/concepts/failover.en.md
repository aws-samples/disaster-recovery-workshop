**Failover** is the process of recovering the system to overcome a crash. For this process to occur, it is necessary to implement mechanisms at various levels of a solution, such as: physical structure, communication links, cooling, hardware, database, application, etc. The purpose of this process is for the system to continue working even with failures in some component.

**Failback** is the process of restoring a system after failover. The goal is to return the system to its pre-failure state.
