To increase the level of resilience of your solution, you can work with more than one AWS region, supporting both an active-active model and a disaster recovery model (*Disaster Recovery*). In the process of sharing resources across regions, it's important to follow the guides for each AWS service. In the whitepaper [Migrating AWS Resources to a New AWS Region](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-migrate-resources-to-new-region.pdf), the step by step migration of resources across regions to different types of services is described.
